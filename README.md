# JANA

JANA is the JLab ANAlysis framework. It is a multi-threaded C++ framework for processing event-based data from particle physics experiments. It has been primarily used by the GlueX experiment at Jefferson Lab.

The JANA project is being replaced by JANA2 which is currently under development.
